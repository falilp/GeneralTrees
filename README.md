# GeneralTrees
A general tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of interconnected nodes. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and a parent node can have multiple children. Unlike binary trees, in general trees a node is not restricted to having only two children.

Some necessary definitions about trees:

-Degree: Number of children of a node. The degree of a tree is the maximum of the degrees of its nodes.

-Root: The only node in a tree that does not have its own ancestors.

-Leaf: Node that does not have its own descendants.

-Subtree: Set of nodes formed by a node and all its descendants.

-Branch: Path that ends in a leaf node.

-Height: The height of a node is the length of the longest branch that starts from said node. The height of a tree is the height of the root node.

-Depth: The depth of a node is the length of the only path from the root to that node.

-Level: The level of a node matches its depth.
